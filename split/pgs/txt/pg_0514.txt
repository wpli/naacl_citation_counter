7 Conclusions
Semantic roles encode semantic links between a verb and its arguments. Among other role labels, PropBank uses numbered arguments (ARG0 , ARG1 , etc.) to encode the core arguments of a verb, and ARGM - LOC to encode the location. This paper exploits these numbered arguments and ARGM - LOC in order to infer temporally-anchored spatial knowledge. This knowledge encodes whether a numbered argument x is or is not located in a location y, and temporally anchors this information with respect to the verb to which y attaches. An annotation effort with 200 sentences from OntoNotes has been presented. First, potential additional spatial knowledge is generated automatically (Algorithm 1). Then, annotators following straightforward guidelines answer questions asking for intuitive spatial information, including uncertainty. The result is annotations with high inter-annotator agreements that encode spatial knowledge as understood by humans when reading text. Experimental results show that inferring additional spatial knowledge can be done with a modest weighted F-measure of 0.55. Results are higher for certYES and probYES (0.71 and 0.60), the labels that indicate that something is certainly or probably located somewhere. Simple majority baselines provide strong results, but combining lexical, syntactic and semantic features yields the best results (0.50 vs. 0.55). Inferring spatial knowledge for numeric arguments before and after an event occurs is harder than during the event (0.41 and 0.45 vs. 0.65). The most important conclusion of this work is the fact that given an ARGM - LOC semantic role, temporally-anchored spatial knowledge can be inferred for numbered arguments in the same sentence. Indeed, annotators answered 44% of questions with certYES or certNO, and 50% of questions with probYES or probNO. Another important observation is that spatial knowledge can be inferred from most verbs, not only motion verbs. While it is fairly obvious to infer from John went to Paris that he had LOCATION Paris after went but not before or during, we have shown that verbs such as incarcerated (Figure 1) also grant spatial inferences.
