strate that the model consistently outperforms strong baselines in various query classification and web search tasks. Meanwhile, we demonstrated compactness of the model and the utility of the learned query/document representation for domain adaptation. Our model can be viewed as a general method for learning semantic representations beyond the word level. Beyond query classification and web search, we believe there are many other knowledge sources (e.g. sentiment, paraphrase) that can be incorporated either as classification or ranking tasks. A comprehensive exploration will be pursued as future work.
