GMM baseline in terms of average cepstral distortion. The GMM baseline, is however, the fastest of the compared systems. For both experiments, it is able to produce transformations substantially faster than real-time. The CPU-based local regression baseline achieves the best overall cepstral distortion, but is also the slowest method. In both experiments, it operates at 0.3X real-time speed. The GPU-based local regression method performs only slightly worse overall than the exact method in terms of cepstral distortion, yet in both experiments it operates substantially faster than real-time, nearly as fast as the parametric baseline.

We have demonstrated a method for substantially speeding-up inference using a non-parametric estimator for spectral voice conversion. Related approaches may prove useful for making nonparametric estimators more efficient in other areas of speech and language processing.
