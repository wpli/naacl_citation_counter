Conclusions and future work

In this paper, for the evaluation of text coherence, we go beyond strict entity matching and model the semantic relatedness between distinct entities through the use of world knowledge. Specifically, we incorporate world knowledge into two existing frameworks: (1) the unsupervised graph-based model (G&S), and (2) the supervised entity-grid model (B&L). Across the two frameworks, on both of our evaluation tasks, sentence ordering and summary coherence rating, our enhanced models with world knowledge encoded are shown to be stronger than the corresponding basic models, confirming that semantic relatedness is truly important for coherence modeling and such relatedness can be effectively captured by world knowledge. Moreover, we observe that world knowledge is particularly useful for short documents in sentence ordering, as it provides additional clues to relate sub-topics in the text. In our future work, we wish to explore the effect of our world knowledge in conjunction with discourse relations. Specifically, we plan to incorporate world knowledge into the framework of discourse role matrix (Lin et al., 2011; Feng et al., 2014). In addition, we also plan to develop a more sophisticated feature encoding by distinguishing different types of predicates in world knowledge triples.
