ated manually entered listing data. This approach precludes the need for manual linguistic annotation and instead relies on existing data available from commercial real estate listing services. We modeled the structured data extraction task as text categorization and NER tasks and applied machine learning (SVM) on the automatically generated training datasets. The learned models were then applied on our test set and the predicted values were used to reconstruct listing data matching the manually entered fields. Results suggest that this completely automated approach could substitute or enhance the existing manual data entry workflows. In addition, we have shown that ubiquitous online formats such as PDF and HTML often exploit the interaction of textual and visual elements. Specifically, in the marketing domain, information is often augmented or conveyed by non-textual features such as positioning, font size, color, and images. We explored the use of novel features capturing the visual characteristics of marketing flyers. Results show that the addition of visual features improved overall performance significantly in the context of text categorization and NER.
