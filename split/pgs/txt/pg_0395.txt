Table 10: Impact of various types of variants of modifiers, on the coverage of noun phrase interpretations. Computed as the fraction of the top 10 extracted interpretations produced by a particular variant type, and possibly by other variant types (upper portion); or produced only by a particular variant type, and by no other variant types (lower portion) (Vocab=vocabulary of noun phrases)

templ variants metallica and 50 cent of the modifier art garfunkel, in the context "X albums", allow for the extraction of the interpretation "albums sold by art garfunkel" for the noun phrase "art garfunkel albums", via the interpretations "albums sold by metallica" and "albums sold by 50 cent". Table 10 quantifies the impact of various types of variants, on the coverage of noun phrase interpretations. The scores provided for each variant type correspond to either non-exclusive (upper portion of the table) or exclusive (lower portion) contribution of that variant type towards some extracted interpretations. In other words, in the lower portion, the scores capture the fraction of the top 10 interpretations that are produced only by that particular variant type. Three conclusions can be drawn from the results. First, all variant types contribute to increasing coverage, relative to using only orig-phrase variants. Second, dist-sim variants have a particularly strong impact. Third, wiki-templ variants have a strong impact, but only when the contexts from which they were collected match the context of the noun phrase being interpreted. On the WikiC vocabulary in the lower portion of Table 10, the scores for wiki-templ illustrate the potential that contextual variants have in extracting additional interpretations. Table 11 again quantifies the impact of variant types, but this time on the coverage and, more importantly, accuracy of interpretations extracted for phrases from the gold sets. The scores are computed over the ranked lists of interpretations from the ListQ gold set, as certain types of variants are temporarily disabled in ablation experiments. The upper portion of the table shows results when only 341

Table 11: Impact of various types of variants of modifiers, on the precision of noun phrase interpretations. Computed over the ListQ gold set, at rank 5 in the ranked lists of extracted  interpretations, when various variant types are allowed ( ) or temporarily not allowed (-) to produce interpretations (O=orig-phrase variant type; A=adj-noun variant type; D=dist-sim variant type; W=wiki-templ variant type; Cvg=number of noun phrases from the gold set with some interpretation(s) produced by the allowed variant types; P@5=precision at rank 5; C@5=average presence of any interpretations annotated as correct and generic (cg) or correct and specific (cs), among interpretations up to rank 5)

one of the variant types is enabled. It shows that none of the variant types, taken in isolation, can match what they achieve when combined together, in terms of both coverage and accuracy. The middle portion of the table shows results when all but one of the variant types are enabled. Each of the variant types incrementally contributes to higher coverage and accuracy over the combination of the other variant types. The incremental contribution of wikitempl variants is the smallest. The lower portion of Table 11 gives the incremental contribution of the variant types, relative to using only the orig-phrase variant type. The last row of Table 11 corresponds to all variant types being enabled. Discussion: Independently of the choice of the textual data source (e.g., documents, queries) from which interpretations are extracted, a noun phrase is intuitively more difficult to interpret if it is relatively more rare or more complex (i.e., longer). Additional experiments quantify the effect, by measuring the correlation between the presence of some extracted interpretations for an input noun phrase, on one hand; and the frequency of the noun phrase as a query (in Table 12), on the other hand. In Table 12,
