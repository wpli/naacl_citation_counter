We first evaluate the model at PMpron . Table 4 shows that, despite less than 50% exact matches, over 90% of the 1000-best lists contain the correct pronunciation. This motivates our model combination and reranking, which increase exact matches to over 50%. Next, we evaluate PM (Table 5). A component word mini-LM dramatically improves PM compared to PM . Filtering out component words provides additional gain, to 45% exact matches. In comparison, a baseline that merges W1 pron and 2 Wpron at the first shared phoneme achieves 33% exact matches for PMpron and 25% for PM. Table 6 provides examples of system output. Perfect outputs include "affluenza," "joggling," "tofurkey," and "zeitghost." For others, like "chilax" and "frienemy," the discrepancy is negligible and the hypothesis PM could be considered a correct alternate output. Some hypotheses, like "architecology" and "japanglish," might even be considered superior to their gold counterparts. However, some errors, like "js" and "mman," are clearly unacceptable system outputs.

Conclusion

We implement a data-driven system that generates portmanteaux from component words. To accomplish this, we use an FSM cascade, including a novel 2-input, 1-output multitape FST, and train it on existing portmanteaux. In cross-validated experiments, we achieve 45% exact matches and an average Levenshtein edit distance of 1.59. In addition to improving this model, we are interested in developing systems that can select component words for portmanteaux and reconstruct component words from portmanteaux. We also plan to research other applications for multi-input/output models.
