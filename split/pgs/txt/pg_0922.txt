Table 3: Mean values of syntactic complexity metrics for the different patient groups. Features which show no significant difference between the manual and automatic segmentation on all three clinical groups are marked as "NS" (not significant). transcripts. Since these syntactic units are typically sub-clausal, this is not unexpected given the arguments above. The remaining primary syntactic unit, the coordinate phrase (CP), is different in the automatic transcripts. This represents a weakness of our method; namely, it has a tendency to insert a boundary before all coordinating conjunctions, as in Example 2:
Manual: So she is very upset and she's crying and with her fairy godmother who then uh creates a carriage and horses and horsemen and and driver and beautiful dress and magical shoes. Auto: So she is very upset. And she's crying and with her. Fairy godmother who then uh creates a carriage. And horses and horsemen and and driver. And beautiful dress. And magical shoes.

(MLC), and T-unit (MLT) are all significantly different in the automatically segmented transcripts. We ascribe this to the fact that a small change in C or T can lead to a large change in MLC or MLT. The remaining metrics in Table 3 are simply combinations of the primary units discussed above. Our analysis so far suggests that some syntactic units are relatively impervious to the automatic sentence segmentation, while others are more susceptible to error. However, when we examine the mean values given in Table 3, we observe that even in cases when the complexity metrics are significantly different in the automatic transcripts, the differences appear to be systematic. For example, we know that our segmentation method tends to produce more sentences than appear in the manual transcripts (i.e., S is always greater in the automatic transcripts). If we look at the differences across clinical groups, the same pattern emerges in both the man-

In this case, the manual transcript has five coordinate phrases, while the automatic transcript has only two. The mean lengths of sentence (MLS), clause 868
