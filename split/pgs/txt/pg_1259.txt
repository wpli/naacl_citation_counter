SF corpus. In our experiment, we use 343 triggers and 38 triggers on average for each fact type2 . We examine all the sentences containing any possible triggers. The presence of a word in one trigger list does not necessarily mean that the sentence contains an event or a relation. For instance, the second child in the following sentence is part of an organization's name. He and his wife, Ann McGarry Buchwald moved to Washington in 1963 with their [<child>], who was adopted from orphanages and [<child> welfare agencies] in Ireland, Spain and France. We also keep such sentences and annotate their trigger scopes without distinction. Note that we only mark the syntactic head of a trigger phrase. For example, we mark child for the noun phrase the second child. 2.1.3 Scope Tagging

2.2.1 Rule-based Method This method is used to investigate the performance of trigger scoping strategy when we do not have any labeled data. We use trigger as the left scope boundary. A verb or trigger with other fact types is regarded as the right boundary. The rule-based scoping result of the walk-through example is as follows: Paul Francis Conrad and his twin [<brother>, James, were] [<born> in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on June 27, 1924,] [<sons> of Robert H. Conrad and Florence Lawler Conrad.] 2.2.2 Supervised Classification Alternatively we regard scope identification as a classification task. For each detected trigger, scope identification is performed as a binary classification of each token in the sentence as to whether it is within or outside of a trigger's scope. We apply the Stanford CoreNLP toolkit (Manning et al., 2014) to annotate part-of-speech tags and names in each document. We design the following features to train a classifier.  Position: The feature takes value 1 if the word appears before the trigger, and 0 otherwise.  Distance: The distance (in words) between the word and the trigger.  POS: POS tags of the word and the trigger.  Name Entity: The name entity type of the word.  Interrupt: The feature takes value 1 if there is a verb or a trigger with other fact type between the trigger and the word, and 0 otherwise. Verbs and triggers with other fact types can effectively change the current topic or continue in another way. Note that the trained classifier can make predictions that result in nonconsecutive blocks of scope tokens. In this case, we aggregate the labels of all the words of an entity to assign a global label, which means that we assign the entity the majority label of the words it contains.

During the scope annotation, we first include the trigger within its own scope and then mark its left and right boundaries. Usually the left boundary is the trigger itself. When there are multiple triggers in the same sentence, we annotate each trigger's scope separately since it is possible that the scopes of different triggers are overlapped or nested as shown in the following instance (the scope of daughters covers the scope of wife): Pavarotti had three [<daughters> with his first wife, Lorenza, Cristina and Giuliana; and one, Alice, with his second wife]. Pavarotti had three daughters with his first [<wife>], Lorenza, Cristina and Giuliana; and one, Alice, with his second [<wife>]. The scope of a word is not transitive. In the phrase "his [<son>'s home] in Washington", home is within son's scope and in Washington is within home's scope, however, the last prepositional phrase is outside of son's scope. 2.2 Scope Identification

We will introduce two methods for identifying trigger scopes.
