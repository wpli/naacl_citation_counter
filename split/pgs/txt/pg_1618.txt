4.2.3.1 Acquirement Patterns At the beginning of a review people often explain how they acquired the product: (13) I bought this camera for my deployment to Iraq. (objective) It was in my cargo pants pocket one day I took it out and the lens was cracked and the silver trim ring had fallen off. (negative) We formalize this feature as follows: [I | we] [verb synonymous to "acquire"|verb of decision + verb synonymous to "acquire"], or, more specifically: [I | we] [ordered | bought | got .* as a gift | purchased | decided to buy...] All verbs are in past simple tense, as only in this tense they are unlikely to bear any sentiment (compare, for example, sentences with the same verbs in present perfect tense: (14) However, I am glad that I have bought a mac.(positive) (15) This is probably the worst book I've bought. (negative) Moreover, this pattern is likely to be used at the beginning of the review, so we add ACQUIRE feature only to those segments which appear in the first 25% of a review. 4.2.3.2 Personal Background Patterns In these patterns, the authors offer their personal information that is relevant to the subject matter of the review and can support their opinion. For instance, in the following review the author refers to his pets as the major reason for buying a particular vacuum cleaner: (16) I have a cat and a dog, and there is lots of shedding hair, all the time. (objective, personal background)

When I saw the DC25 Animal, I decided to spend the money hoping that this vacuum would do the job. (objective, acquirement) It has lived up to my wildest dreams, it is wonderfully easy to handle, so easy to maneuver, the 16 lbs make such a difference compared to those very heavy machines I had before, I had no problem carrying it upstairs. (positive) We formalize this feature as follows: [I|we] [am (a|an)|have (a|an)|'m (a|an)|am not (a|an)] The indefinite article is used to prevent matching such polar expressions, as I'm very pleased with the quality of this product. Again, such patterns are searched for only at the beginning of a review. 4.2.3.3 Personal Experience Patterns These patterns also serve to provide some background information about user's experiences to back up his opinion on a product: (17) Usually I am a huge fan of hats that look like food. (objective, personal background). My meatloaf hat has been a hit for years. (objective, personal experience) When I received my turkey hat I carefully unwrapped the bubble wrap and gazed upon its tan beauty. (positive). To capture this pattern we search for verbs in perfect forms (except for the verbs of possession). We exclude verbs in perfect continuous forms, as they are more often used to describe positive or negative results of using a product. Compare, for example: (18) I have been using it for almost a month and my lashes are so long, they touch my eyebrows... (positive) We also exclude phrases that have "should/could" before "have", as they often express negative sentiments (Liu, 2014):
