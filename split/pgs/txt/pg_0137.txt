lationship between the candidate report-source pair, we allow our system to learn (1) that having similar topic distributions between reports and sources is indicative of a link, and (2) which topics are most important for predicting a link. Because we used a linear kernel, we are able to discern exactly how important it ranks each topic. A cursory, qualitative assessment of its metric shows promising and competitive performance with that of Pointwise Mutual Information and Topic Coherence.
