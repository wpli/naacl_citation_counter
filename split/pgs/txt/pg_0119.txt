al. (2014) of two semantic-based treebanks, derived from two HPSG resources, the DeepBank (DM, (Flickinger et al., 2012)) and the Enju's predicate argument structure (PAS, (Miyao and Tsujii, 2005)), to investigate the impact of syntactic features on a transition-based graph parser. Our results show that surface syntactic features significantly improve the parsing of predicate-argument structures. More specifically, we show that adding syntactic context improves the recognition of long distance dependencies and elliptical constructions. We finally discuss the usefulness of our approach, when applied on a second-order model based on dual decomposition (Martins and Almeida, 2014), showing that our use of syntactic features enhances this model accuracy and provides state-of-the-art performance.

PAS data set is an extraction of predicate-argument structures from the Enju HPSG treebank and contains word-to-word semantic dependencies. Each dependency type is made of two elements: a coarse part-of-speech of the head predicate dependent (e.g. verb and adjective), and the argument (e.g. ARG1 and ARG2). Although both are derived from HSPG resources (a hand-crafted grammar for DM, a treebank-based one for PAS), they differ in their core linguistic choices (functional heads vs lexical heads, coordination scheme, etc.) leading to different views of the predicate argument structure for the same sentence (Ivanova et al., 2012). Thus, even though both corpora may appear to contain a similar number of dependency labels, as shown in Table 1, their annotation schemes depict a deeply divergent linguistic reality exposed by two very different distributions. In DM, 9 labels account for almost 95% of all dependencies whereas a label set twice as large covers the same percentage for PAS, as shown in Table 2. Furthermore, semantically empty elements are widespread in the DeepBank (around 21.5%), compared to a low rate of 4.3% in PAS. In other words, the latter is somewhat more dense and consequently more syntactic. This is due to the fact that PAS integrates markers for infinitives, auxiliaries, and most punctuation marks into its graphs, whereas DM considers them as semantically void. DM corpus is clearly heading toward more semantic analysis while the PAS corpus aims at providing a more abstract deep syntax analysis than regular surface syntax trees. Both treebanks are used in their bilexical dependency formats.

Deep Syntax and Underspecified Semantic Corpora

DeepBank Corpus Semantic dependency graphs in the DM Corpus are the result of a two-step simplification of the underspecified logical-form meaning representations, based on Minimal Recursion Semantic (MRS, (Copestake et al., 1995; Copestake et al., 2005)), derived from the manually annotated DeepBank treebank (Flickinger et al., 2012). First, Oepen and Lønning (2006) define a conversion from original MRS formulae to variable-free Elementary Dependency Structures (EDS), which (a) maps each predication in the MRS logical-form meaning representation to a node in a dependency graph and (b) transforms argument relations represented by shared logical variables into directed dependency links between graph nodes. Then, in a second conversion step, the EDS graphs are further reduced into strict bi-lexical form, i.e. a set of directed, binary dependency relations holding exclusively between lexical units (Ivanova et al., 2012). Even though both conversion steps are, by design, lossy, DM semantic dependency graphs present a true subset of the information encoded in the full, original MRS data set. Predicate-Argument Structure Corpus Enju Predicate-Argument Structures (PAS Corpus) are derived from the automatic HPSG-style annotation of the Penn Treebank (Miyao and Tsujii, 2004) that was primarily used for the development of the Enju parsing system (Miyao and Tsujii, 2005).
