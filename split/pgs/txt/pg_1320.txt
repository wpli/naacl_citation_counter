Conclusion and Future Work

In this paper we report the density peaks sentence clustering (DPSC) method for multi-document summarization. Different from the prior work which deals with representativeness and redundancy independently, a unified sentence scoring model is designed in DPSC to combine the representativeness score, the diversity score and the length score of each sentence. Experimental results on DUC04 dataset show that DPSC outperforms the DUC04 best method and the existing clusteringbased methods. Meanwhile, it yields close results when compared with the state-of-the-art generic MDS methods. It is thus verified that density peaks clustering algorithm is able to handle MDS effectively. However, this work is still preliminary. We will study semantic text similarity to improve the sentence similarity matrix. We will then apply the proposed method in query-based multi-document summarization.
