ing, which in turn has a single address. In contrast, broker information and space information are multivalue attributes. A listing is typically represented by multiple brokers and can contain multiple spaces. To construct listing information in the case of multivalue attributes, we used all predicted named entities of the corresponding types. The predicted listing information was then compared to the gold standard of manually entered listing data. The construction of listing data (for comparison with manually entered data) resulted in a strict performance measure. We consider an answer to be correct only if both the entity boundaries and entity type are accurately predicted. In addition, in the case of single value attributes, only the highest ranking named entity (based on estimated probabilities) was retained. Results are shown in Table 6. We compared performance of classifiers using only textual features (first 3 columns), versus performance using both textual and visual features (next 3 columns).

considered relevant for the purposes of listing services. For example, the size of an office space is typically entered, while the size of an office associated with a retail or industrial space is typically omitted. Similarly, lot size is included in building and land listings, but excluded when the listing refers to a unit (or multiple units) within a building. Essential space information is usually prominently displayed and as a result easy to identify. Similarly, named entities referring to address information also showed overall significant improvement. As noted earlier, the property address (vs other addresses in the flyer) is typically visually prominent. In both cases, visual features proved useful predictors.

Discussion

In both the text categorization and NER tasks performance improved significantly over the baseline with the addition of typographic and visual features. However, in both cases, improvements were somewhat moderate (around 3% on average). Further improvement could be achieved by including features that account for additional visual characteristics, such as a measure of how eye-catching or striking the relative font color differences are, the perceived contrast between foreground and background colors, etc. In future work, we could also add to the overall system an image classification component. It has been noted that occasionally the only indicator of the property type of a flyer is present in embedded flyer images and not present in the flyer text. For example, a number of flyers display images of the inside and outside of restaurants, gas stations, shopping malls and thus specify the property type as retail without giving additional textual clues. Similarly, an image of a warehouse, a land parcel, or an areal photo of a shopping center explicitly identify the listing property type. Lastly, it should be noted that an overall system performance baseline is one that measures the average performance of data entry staff in commercial real estate listing services. However, the terms and conditions of most listing services prohibit gathering and using data for such purposes. We were able to collect a very small set of listings (100 listings)

The addition of visual features significantly13 increased the overall F1-score from 83.8 to 86.5%. Performance gains are more significant for named entities that are typically visually salient and are otherwise difficult (or impossible) to identify in a textonly version of the flyers. In particular, improvements were most significant for named entities referring to space information. A flyer typically describes multiple spaces, however, only a few of these are
The difference is statistically significant with p value < 0.05% using Z-test on two proportions.
