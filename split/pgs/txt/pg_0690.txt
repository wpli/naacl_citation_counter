were regarded as potential slot-fillers for the patterns. Recall that SLV and SID are the sets of paraphrases generated by LEXVAR and IDENT , respectively, and SLV  SID . Pairs that appeared in SSeed and those used in completely dissimilar contexts were excluded from both SID and SLV . Figure 3 demonstrates that, irrespective of the size of the bilingual corpus, LEXVAR yielded far more (relative) coverage of paraphrase pairs SLV than not only SSeed but also SID . When the full bilingual corpora were used, SLV contained 63.8 M and 137.6 M paraphrase pairs in the two respective settings, while SID contained only 26.8 M and 53.0 M pairs. The seed set SSeed can be pooled with SLV ; thus, LEXVAR expanded SSeed by approximately 67 and 101 times in the two respective settings. Figure 4 illustrates the ratio of the expanded parts of the paraphrase lexicons SLV and SID against the seed set SSeed . The ratio of SLV against SSeed ranged over 41­109 and 100­205 in the two respective settings. This figure also emphasizes the visible advantage of SLV over SID : 84%­208% and 139%­ 159% more coverage.

We expected that the more the bilingual data there are, the lower the leverage ratio is, because when a larger bilingual corpus is used, more seed paraphrases can be acquired, and the relative size of the monolingual data compared to the bilingual is lower. While the leverage ratio in the NTCIR setting follows this, the ratio in the Europarl setting does not: it peaks at approximately the middle of the scale. We found that from a very small bilingual corpus, we do not necessarily obtain seed paraphrases that exhibit
