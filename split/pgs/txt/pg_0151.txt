most discriminative. Table 5 shows the accuracy of each type of n-gram for each of the different corpora. Table 5(a) shows that the top four categories for single-domain AA are: prefix, suffix, space-prefix, and mid-word. These four categories have the best performance on both CCAT 10 and CCAT 50. In contrast, Table 5(b) shows that the top four categories for cross-domain AA are: prefix, space-prefix, beg97

punct, and mid-punct. For both single-domain and cross-domain AA, prefix and space-prefix are strong features, and are generally better than the suffix features, perhaps because authors have more control over prefixes in English, while suffixes are often obligatory for grammatical reasons. For cross-domain AA, beg-punct and midpunct are the top features, likely because an author's
