Conclusions

We presented a simple approach, BARISTA, to learning bilingual embeddings. BARISTA has the advantages that it (a) is independent of the choice of embedding algorithm, (b) does not require parallel data, and (c) can be adapted to specific tasks by using appropriate dictionaries. Our embeddings proved useful for cross-language POS/SuS tagging.
