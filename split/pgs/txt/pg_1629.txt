Gasser (1975), Crawford and Aycock (2008), and Shay et al. (2012) describe systems that produce meaningless but pronounceable passwords, such as "tufritvi" . However, their systems can only assign  230 distinct passwords. Jeyaraman and Topkara (2005) suggest generating a random sequence of characters, and finding a mnemonic for it in a text corpus. A limited corpus means they again have a small space of systemassigned passwords. We propose a similar method in Section 2.2, but we automatically synthesize a new mnemonic word sequence. Kurzban (1985) and Shay et al. (2012) use a method similar to XKCD with small dictionaries. This leads to longer nonsense sequences that can be difficult to remember.

Conclusion

We introduced several methods for generating secure passwords in the form of English word sequences. We learned that long sentences are seemingly easy to remember, but actually hard to reproduce, and we also learned that our poetry method produced relatively short, memorable passwords that are liked by users.
