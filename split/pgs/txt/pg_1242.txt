Since the scores generated by our method are continuous and segment-level metrics are also required to output continuous-valued scores, we can now compare the scores directly using Pearson's correlation. Pearson's correlation has three main advantages for this purpose. Firstly, the measure is unit-free, so metrics do not have to produce scores on the same scale as the human assessments. Secondly, scores are absolute as opposed to relative and therefore more intuitive and ultimately more powerful; for example, we are able to evaluate metrics over the 20% of translations of highest or lowest quality in the test set. Finally, the use of Pearson's correlation facilitates the measurement of statistical significance in correlation differences. It is important to point out, however, that moving from Kendall's  over relative preference judgments to Pearson's r over absolute scores does, in fact, change the task required of metrics in one respect: previously, there was no direct evaluation of the scores generated by a metric, nor indeed did the evaluation ever directly compare translations for different source language inputs (as relative preference judgments were always relative to other translations for the same input). Pearson's correlation, on the other hand, compares scores across the entire test set. 4.1 Significance Testing of Segment-level Metrics

Table 2: Pearson's correlation and Kendall's  between W MT-13 segment-level metrics and human assessment for Spanish-to-English (ES - EN ). Note that Kendall's  is based on the WMT-13 formulation, and the preference judgments from WMT-13.

With the move to Pearson's correlation, we can also test statistical significance in differences between metrics, based on the Williams test (Williams, 1959),3 which evaluates significance in a difference in dependent correlations (Steiger, 1980). As suggested by Graham and Baldwin (2014), the test is appropriate for evaluation of document-level MT metrics since the data is not independent, and for similar reasons, the test can also be used for evaluation of segment-level metrics. 4.2 Spanish-to-English Segment-level Metrics We first carry out tests for Spanish-to-English segment-level metrics from W MT-13. In our experiments in Section 3.1, we used only a sub-sample

of segments, so the first thing is to collect assessments for the remaining Spanish-to-English translation segments using MTurk, based on a sample of at least 15 assessments. A total of 24 HITs of 100 translations each were posted on MTurk; after removal of low quality workers (50%) and quality control items (a further 30%), this resulted in 840 translation segments with 15 or more assessments each. The scores were standardized and combined into mean segment scores. Table 2 shows the Pearson's correlation for each metric that participated in the W MT-13 Spanish-toEnglish evaluation task, along with the Kendall's  based on the original W MT-13 methodology and relative preference assessments. Overall, when we compare correlations using the new evaluation methodology to those from the original evaluation, even though we have raised the bar by assessing the raw numeric outputs rather than translating them into preference judgments relative to other translations for the same SL input, all metrics achieve higher correlation with human judgment than reported in the original evaluation. This indicates that the new evaluation setup is by no means unrealistically difficult, and that even though it was not required of the metrics in the original task setup, the metrics are doing a relatively good job of absolute scoring of translation adequacy.
