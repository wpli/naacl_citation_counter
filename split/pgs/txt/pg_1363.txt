Conclusion

We addressed the task of automatically extracting numerical attributes of physical objects. We propose representing the sizes of objects using a linear function. We used the combined regression and ranking model with both absolute and relative clues. Currently, many features are extracted from a thesaurus WordNet. If we can extract effective features from other resources, we would be able to apply our method to the objects that are not in the thesaurus. Future work also includes the following:  more accurately collecting physical objects,  sense disambiguation of words in clues,

 use of superlative sentences,  filtering out descriptions of rare events,  a more effective way of using glosses,  application to other attributes, e.g., weight,  handling idioms.
