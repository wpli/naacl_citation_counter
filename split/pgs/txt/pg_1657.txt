The results of this evaluation suggest that reading times are mostly affected by local hierarchic structure, but the fact that GCG PCFG surprisal is able to provide a significant fit even in the presence of the PTB PCFG surprisal predictor suggests that some non-local information affects reading times. In particular, while this evaluation showed that accumulated syntactic context is not generally a good predictor of reading times, some or all of the non-local information contained in the GCG categories is used by readers and so influences reading time durations over the local structural information reflected in the PTB PCFG surprisal measure. during processing and so would have a strong influence on the reading time measures used in the present study. Such decisions would have to be conditioned on hierarchic structural information not present in either PTB PCFG surprisal or the sequential structure models of Frank and Bod (2011). Further, predictability has been shown to affect word duration during speech production (Jurafsky et al., 2001; Aylett and Turk, 2006), and Demberg et al. (2012) found that hierarchic structure significantly improves over n-gram computations of predictability in that domain as well. Together, these findings suggest that hierarchic structure is not only a convenient descriptive tool for linguists, but that such structure is deeply rooted in the human language processor and is used during online language processing. Previous work has made a distinction between lexical surprisal, syntactic surprisal, and total surprisal (Demberg and Keller, 2008; Roark et al., 2009). Given a prefix derivation of the structure of the context, syntactic surprisal measures the information obtained by generating the structure that will enable the attachment of a newly observed lexical item. Lexical surprisal conveys the amount of information obtained by attaching the particular lexical observation to the new syntactic structure. Total surprisal is the original formulation of surprisal and is the composition of the other two types of surprisal (the information gained by generating a structure for the current lexical observation and attaching the observation to that structure). Fossum and Levy (2012) show that, with a non-cumulative bigram baseline, this distinction is not significant when predicting

Discussion

The finding that the hierarchic grammars orthogonally improve reading time predictions suggests that hierarchic structural information has a significant influence on reading times. Since both the PTB and GCG calculations of surprisal contain sequential information (e.g., of part-of-speech tags), if the effect in this study was driven by purely sequential information as suggested by Frank and Bod (2011), one might expect either the PTB or the GCG calculations of surprisal (but not both) to be a significant predictor of reading times. Instead, the present set of results support recent claims made by van Schijndel et al. (2014) that nonlocal subcategorization decisions are made early 1603
