2.1.2 Parallel and Comparable Corpora Much effort has gone into compiling monolingual parallel corpora and extracting paraphrases from them by identifying corresponding parts of aligned sentences. Barzilay and McKeown (2001) and Pang et al. (2003) collected multiple human translations of the same source text. Multiple verbalizations of mathematical proofs were also used (Barzilay and Lee, 2002). This triangulating method provides solid anchors that guarantee the semantic equivalence of sentences (or text fragments). Monolingual comparable corpora are also useful sources of paraphrases. For instance, articles from different newswire services describing the same event can be used in that way (Shinyama et al., 2002; Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003; Dolan et al., 2004; Wubben et al., 2009). Chen and Dolan (2011) created such corpora by collecting multiple descriptions of short movies through crowdsourcing. Webharvested definition sentences of the same term often contain paraphrases (Hashimoto et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2013). Bilingual parallel corpora have been recognized as sources of paraphrases since (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005). First, a translation table is created using techniques developed for statistical machine translation. Then, pairs of expressions in the same language that share the same translations are extracted. For instance, a pair ("under control", "in check") will be extracted if they are both linked with the German translation "unter controlle." Each paraphrase pair (e1 , e2 ) is assigned probabilities, p(e2 |e1 ) and p(e1 |e2 ), estimated by marginalizing over all the translations F shared by e1 and e2 ,  i.e., p(e2 |e1 ) = f F p(e2 |f )p(f |e1 ). This bilingual pivoting approach inspired further techniques such as the use of syntactic information as the basis of constraints (Callison-Burch, 2008; Zhao et al., 2009), learning patterns using synchronous grammar (Ganitkevitch et al., 2011), uncovering missing links by combining multiple translation tables and other lexical resources (Kok and Brockett, 2010), and re-ranking candidate pairs on the basis of contextual similarity (Chan et al., 2011). Ganitkevitch and Callison-Burch (2014) compiled paraphrase lexicons for various languages on this approach.

While the generality underlying paraphrases has been exploited either by handcrafted rules (Harris, 1957; Mel' cuk and Polgu` ere, 1987; Jacquemin, 1999; Fujita et al., 2007) or by data-driven techniques (Ganitkevitch et al., 2011; Fujita et al., 2012), we still lack a robust and accurate way of identifying various types of lexical variants. Our method tackles this issue using affix patterns that are also acquired from high-quality seed paraphrases in a fully empirical way. Consequently, our method has the potential to apply to many languages.

2.1 Creating Paraphrase Lexicons Researchers have been intensively studying methods for automatically creating paraphrase lexicons using various types of corpora. There are two major streams: one that uses monolingual corpora and one that uses parallel or comparable corpora. 2.1.1 Monolingual Corpora A monolingual corpus is the most promising resource when targeting increased coverage, thanks to the availability of Web-scale monolingual data. Techniques that use such corpora mostly extract pairs of expressions by exploiting the contextual similarity associated with the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1954). A given expression is represented with its co-occurring expressions such as adjacent word n-grams (Pas ¸ca and Dienes, 2005; Bhagat and Ravichandran, 2008; Marton, 2013), nominal elements (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Szpektor et al., 2004; De Saeger et al., 2011), and modifiers and modified words (Hagiwara et al., 2006). The similarity of a pair of expressions is calculated by comparing the distributions of their contexts. Despite the quantitative advantage, this approach tends to result in low accuracy. This is because contextual information alone often fails to differentiate paraphrases from expressions that have other semantic relations, e.g., antonyms and sibling words.
