clues and determines the sizes of many physical objects simultaneously. The approach consists of two steps: (i) many different types of clues to the numerical attribute are collected from various linguistics resources, and (ii) those collected clues are brought together by a combined regression and ranking.

to define (e.g., earth, location, soil). We further filter out approximately 400 synsets for various reasons such as ambiguity.1 3.2 Collecting absolute clues We collect absolute clues, which indicate a value of a physical object without reference to other physical objects. We used a search engine2 with a query such as ` "the size of A" AND meter' (AND represents a logical conjunction) and decompose the retrieved snippets into text fragments with "..." as a delimiter. We used only the first 1,000 pages (the maximum amount allowed by the terms of use for API users) for the query comprising a pattern ("the size of A", "the length of A", or "the height of A") and a length unit (millimeter, centimeter, meter, or kilometer). Note that absolute clues are corpus-based. 3.3 Collecting relative clues We also collect relative clues, which suggest a numerical order relation between two physical objects, i.e., A should be larger than B . Note that holonymy and comparative sentences below are explicit relative clues as opposed to implicit relative clues that follow. Note also that holonymy is WordNet-based while comparative sentences and implicit relative clues are corpus-based. 3.3.1 Holonymy If A is a part of B , it usually means that A is smaller than B . We can obtain such part-of (holonymy) relations from the WordNet. Specifically, for each physical object obtained in Section 3.1, we retrieve its holonymy synsets. If a synset is a holonym of another synset, it suggests that the former is larger than the latter. 3.3.2 Comparative sentences The sentence "the middle finger is longer than the ring finger" suggests that the relation `middle finger > ring finger' holds for the size attribute. We collect such comparative sentences. Specifically, we search

Hovy et al. (2002) pointed out the importance of the knowledge on the numerical attributes in question answering. They hand-coded the possible range of a numerical attribute. Akiba et al. (2004), Fujihata et al. (2001), Aramaki et al. (2007), and Bakalov et al. (2011) made similar attempts. Their target, however, is the fixed numerical attributes of the named entities, while our target is the numerical attributes of general physical objects, not restricted to the named entities. Davidov and Rappoport (2010) collected various types of text fragments indicating values of numerical attributes of physical objects. Our work differs from theirs in that we explore more subtle linguistic clues in addition to those used in the previous work, by using a global mathematical model that brings together all the clues. Narisawa et al. (2013) tried to determine whether a given amount is large, small, or normal as a size of an object, making good use of clue words such as only ; The sentence "This laptop weighs only 0.7kg" means that laptops are usually heavier than 0.7kg.

3 Fragmentary clues to sizes
3.1 Physical objects We first collect physical objects, i.e., objects for which the size can be defined. However, the numerical attribute of a word depends on the sense in which the word is being used. We will therefore determine the size of each sense instead of each word. Specifically, we determine the size of each noun synset in the Japanese WordNet (Bond et al., 2009). We basically regard as physical objects the synsets that are descendants of the synset corresponding to "physical objects" (00002684-n). We filter out the physical objects that are descendants of any of the following synsets ( 09334396-n, 00027167-n, 09239740-n, 09287968-n, 09277686-n, 09335240-n, 04564698n, and 03670849-n), since their sizes would be hard
