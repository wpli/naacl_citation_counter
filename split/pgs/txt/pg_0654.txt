1939) of Swahili word types. Despite a strong susceptibility of Swahili to borrowing and a large fraction of Swahili words originating from Arabic, the two languages are typologically distinct with profoundly dissimilar phonological and morpho-syntactic systems. Therefore, Arabic loanwords have been substantially adapted to conform to Swahili phonotactics, which we survey briefly. First, Arabic has five syllable patterns:3 CV, CVV, CVC, CVCC, and CVVC (McCarthy, 1985, pp. 23­28), whereas Swahili (like other Bantu languages) is characterized by the syllable ending with a vowel and CV or V syllable structure. At the segment level, Swahili loanword adaptation thus involves extensive vowel epenthesis in consonant clusters and at a syllable final position if the syllable ends with a consonant, e.g., : (ktAb)  kitabu `book' (Polomé, 1967; Schadeberg, 2009; Mwita, 2009). Second, phonological adaptation in Swahili loanwords includes shortening of vowels (unlike Arabic, Swahili does not have
For simplicity, we subsume Omani Arabic and other historical dialects of Arabic under the label "Arabic"; similarly, we subsume Swahili, its dialects and protolanguages under "Swahili". 3 C stands for consonant, and V for vowel.

phonemic length); substitution of consonants that are found in Arabic but not in Swahili (e.g., emphatic (pharyngealized) /tQ //t/, voiceless velar fricative /x//k/, dental fricatives /T//s/, /D//z/, and the voiced velar fricative /G//g/); adoption of Arabic phonemes that were not originally present in Swahili /T/, /D/, /G/ (e.g., (tH*yr) tahadhari `warning'); degemination of Arabic geminate consonants (e.g., ($r~) shari `evil'). Finally, adapted loanwords can freely undergo Swahili inflectional and derivational processes, e.g., (Alwzyr) 3 Generating loanword candidates  waziri `minister', mawaziri `ministers', kiuwaziri `ministerial' (Zawawi, 1979; Schadeberg, 2009). In this section, we use the Arabic­Swahili languagepair to describe the prototypical linguistic adaptation processes that words undergo when borrowed. Then, 3.2 Arabic­Swahili borrowing transducers we describe how we model these processes.2 We describe unweighted transducers for pronunciation, syllabification, and morphological and phono3.1 Case study: Arabic­Swahili borrowing The Swahili lexicon has been influenced by Arabic logical adaptation. An example that illustrates some due to a prolonged period of language contact in the of the possible string transformations by individual Indian Ocean trading (800 A.D.­1920), as well as the components of the model is shown in figure 2.

According to goal of these transducers is to minimally overgenerseveral independent studies, Arabic loanwords consti- ate Swahili adapted forms of Arabic words, based on tute from 18% (Hurskainen, 2004) to 40% (Johnson, the adaptations described above. Pronunciation. Based on the IPA, we assign shared symbols to sounds that exist in both sound systems of Arabic and Swahili (e.g., nasals /n/, /m/; voiced stops /b/, /d/), and language-specific unique symbols to sounds that are unique to the phonemic inventory of Arabic (e.g., pharyngeal voiced and voiceless fricatives /è/, /Q/) or Swahili (e.g., velar nasal /N/). For Swahili, we construct a pronunciation dictionary based on the Omniglot grapheme-to-IPA mapping.4 In Arabic, we use the CMU Arabic vowelized pronunciation dictionary containing about 700K types which has an average of four pronunciations per word (Metze et al., 2010).5 We then design four transducers--Arabic and Swahili word-to-IPA and IPA-to-word transducers--each as a union of linear chain transducers, as well as one acceptor per pronunciation dictionary listing.
www.omniglot.com Since we are working at the level of word types which have no context, we cannot disambiguate the intended form, so we include all options. For example, for the input word (ktAbA) `book.sg.indef', we use both pronunciations /kitAbA/ and /kuttAbA/.

the phonological system of the recipient language is encoded as a system of constraints, and these constraints account for how the donor word is adapted when borrowed. There has been substantial prior work in linguistics on borrowing in the OT paradigm (Yip, 1993; Davidson and Noyer, 1997; Jacobs and Gussenhoven, 2000; Kang, 2003; Broselow, 2004; Adler, 2006; Rose and Demuth, 2006; Kenstowicz and Suchato, 2006; Kenstowicz, 2007; Mwita, 2009), but none of it has led to computational realizations.
