nate identification at cross-validation and concepts subsets experiments. In future, we plan to make a larger dataset of cognacy judgments for other language families in a richer phonetic transcription and integrate articulatory phonetic features into the feature vectors for the purpose of cognate identification. We also plan on testing with different feature vector combinations.
