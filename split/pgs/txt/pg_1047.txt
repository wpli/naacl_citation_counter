of the core semantic identities for these words may contribute greatly to the similarity judgments for humans and machines alike, and these shared properties may be considered general knowledge about the words. For the related words, for example computer : keyboard, it may be difficult to pinpoint the semantic overlap between the components which build up the core semantic identities of these words, and none is observed in the data. General knowledge of a certain word may be found in explanatory texts about the word like dictionaries or encyclopedias, but rarely found in texts other than that. It would be assumed by the writers of informative non-explanatory texts like news articles that the readers are well acquainted with all the basic semantic information about the words, therefore repetition of such information would be unnecessary. For a similarity/relatedness judgment task where basic and compositional semantic information may prove to be useful, using a corpus like Google News, where information or context for a particular word assumes one is already conWord Pair Simple Wikipedia COAST east@-1 164 west@-1 137 south@-1 75 north@-1 64 Africa@2 63 Sea@4 55 Atlantic@-1 53 western@-1 52 northern@-1 52 eastern@-1 50 North@2 46 Australia@2 43 southern@-1 40 Pacific@-1 37 America@3 33 city@-4 33 island@3 30 west@-1 16279 east@-1 13662 south@-1 4574 Atlantic@-1 3741 north@-1 3497 Pacific@-1 3383 western@-1 2802 southern@-1 2783 eastern@-1 2771 Sea@-1 2463 America@3 2446 northern@-1 2383 Island@3 2333 North@2 2280 Africa@2 2254 located@-4 2177 island@3 1966 SHORE Lake@2 39 eastern@-1 25 north@-1 17 south@-1 17 Sea@4 14 western@-1 14 northern@-1 12 southern@-1 11 lake@3 10 River@4 8 close@-2 7 Michigan@3 6 washed@-3 5 west@-1 5 island@3 5 sea@-1 5 Texas@-1 4 Lake@2 3700 north@-1 2718 eastern@-1 2567 along@-3 2229 western@-1 2163 located@-4 1955 south@-1 1908 southern@-1 1810 Lake@3 1645 northern@-1 1628 batteries@1 1162 lake@3 1121 Bay@3 1050 River@4 875 east@-1 800 west@-1 785 bombardment@1 664

versant with it, would not be as effective as using a corpus like Wikipedia where general knowledge about a word may be available and repeated. Also, the smaller vocabulary size of Wikipedia compared with Google News would suggest that general knowledge may be conveyed more efficiently with less data sparsity. In the Simple Wikipedia vs. full Wikipedia case, both corpora are explanatory texts. Despite the much smaller size, the general semantic overlap between each pair of similar words seems as evident in Simple Wikipedia as in full Wikipedia. For measurements like cosine similarity where large values in the same dimensions are favored, the basic semantic components which contribute to the similarity judgments for the words are the same comparatively across two different corpora. This may not be surprising because although more information may be present in full Wikipedia, because of its explanatory nature, the core semantic components which make a concept distinct still dominate over new and sparser information added to it.
