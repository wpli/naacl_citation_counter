The decision boundary represented by the dashed line intersects the polytope at only h4 , making it a vertex. No decision boundary intersects h5 without intersecting other points in the polytope, making h5 redundant. conditions for a vertex in Eqn. (8), because we can draw a decision boundary that interests the vertex and no other h  H . We also note h5 is not a vertex, and is redundant to the description of H. Figure 1 of Cer et al. (2008) actually shows a normal fan, although it is not described as such. We now describe how this geometric object is constructed step by step in Figure 2. In Part (a) we identify the edge [h4 , h1 ] in R2 with a decision boundary represented by a dashed line. We have also drawn a vector w normal to the decision boundary that satisfies Eqn. (8). This parameter would result in a tied model score such that wh4 = wh1 . When moving to (R2 ) we see that the normal cone N[h4 ,h1 ] is a ray parallel to w. This ray can be considered as the set of parameter vectors that yield the edge [h4 , h1 ]. The ray is also a decision boundary in (R2 ) , with parameters on either side of the decision boundary maximising either h4 or h1 . Any vector parallel to the edge [h4 , h1 ], such as (h1 - h4 ), can be used to define this decision boundary in (R2 ) . Next in Part (b), with the same procedure we define the normal cone for the edge [h3 , h1 ]. Now both the edges from parts (a) and (b) share the the vertex h1 . This implies that any parameter vector that lies between the two decision boundaries (i.e. between the two rays N[h3 ,h1 ] and N[h4 ,h1 ] ) would maximise the vertex h1 : this is the set of vectors that comprise

A fifth feature vector has been added to illustrate redundancy. modified system from (5) is feasible w(hj - hi ) = 0 w(hk - hi ) < 0, 1  k  K, k = i, k = j w(hl - hj ) < 0, 1  l  K, l = i, l = j which implies that [hs,i , hs,j ] defines a decision boundary in (RD ) between the parameters that maximise hs,i and those that maximise hs,j . Normal Cone For the face F in polytope Hs the normal cone NF takes the form. NF = {w : w(hs,j - hs,i )  0, hs,i  vert(F ), hs,j  vert(Hs )} (10) If the face is a vertex F = {hs,i } then its normal cone N{hs,i } is the set of feasible parameters that satisfy the system in (5). Normal Fan The set of all normal cones associated with the faces of Hs is called the normal fan N (Hs ). 3.2 Drawing a Normal Fan Following the example in Cer et al. (2008) we analyze a system based on two features: the translation PT M (f |e) and language PLM (e) models. For brevity we omit the common sentence index, so that hi = hs,i . The system produces a set of four hypotheses which yield four feature vectors {h1 , h2 , h3 , h4 } (Table 1). To this set of four hypotheses, we add a fifth hypothesis and feature vector h5 to illustrate an infeasible solution. These feature vectors are plotted in Figure 1. The feature vectors form a polytope H shaded in light blue. From Figure 1 we see that h4 satisfies the (9)
