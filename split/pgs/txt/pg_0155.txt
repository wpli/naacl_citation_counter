fix n-grams in both single-domain and cross-domain settings. And we found that word n-grams (capturing topic information) were useful in single domain settings, while puct n-grams (capturing style information) were useful in cross-domain settings. We further found that word n-grams are unnecessary, even in single-domain settings. Models based only on affix and punct n-grams performed as well as models with all n-grams regardless of whether it was a single-domain or cross-domain authorship attribution task. Our findings on the value of selecting n-grams according to the linguistic aspect they represent may also be beneficial in other classification tasks where character n-grams are commonly used. Promising tasks are those related to the stylistic analysis of texts, such as native language identification, document similarity and plagiarism detection. Morphologically speaking, English is a poor language. The fact that we identified significant differences in performance by selecting n-gram categories that are related to affixation in this poorly inflected language suggests that we may find even larger differences in performance in morphologically richer languages. We leave this research question for future work.
