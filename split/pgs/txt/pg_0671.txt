Conclusion

We presented Model Invertibility Regularization (MIR), an unsupervised method for jointly training bidirectional sequence alignment models with or without parallel data. Our formulation is based on the simple observation that the alignment tasks at hand are inherently invertible and encourages the translation tables in both models to behave like pseudo-inverses of each other. We derived an efficient MAP-EM algorithm and demonstrated our method's effectiveness on two different alignment tasks. On word alignment, applying MIR on the IBM4 model yielded the highest F scores and the resulting Bleu scores were comparable to that of Alignment by Agreement (Liang et al., 2006) and PostCAT (Ganchev et al., 2008). Our best MT results (up to +1.5 Bleu improvement) were obtained by combining alignments from both MIR and ABA, indicating that the two methods learn complementary alignments. On Japanese-English backtransliteration with no parallel data, we obtained a significant error reduction over two baseline methods (Ravi and Knight, 2009; Mylonakis et al., 2007). As future work, we plan to apply MIR on largescale MT decipherment (Ravi and Knight, 2011; Dou and Knight, 2013), where, so far, only a single directional model has been used. Another promising direction is to encourage invertibility not only between words, but between their senses and synonyms.
