features alone yield an average F score of 55.9%. Both the Sentential features and Syntactic features (added cumulatively) further improve performance, raising the average F score to 61.8%. The next two rows show the effect of adding the semantic features. WordNet improves performance for Effect and Change but recall is lower for Stop and Other. In contrast, the SemTaggers improve performance across all categories, raising the F score to 64.2%. Our ablation studies show the A NIMAL class contributed most to the improvement. In addition, we explored self-training to exploit unannotated texts. We applied the classifiers to 2,000 unlabeled veterinary texts, and used the newly labeled instances as additional training data. This did not improve performance, presumably because the most common categories dominated the new instances. We then explored a balanced self-training method that enforces an even distribution of the six categories in the new training instances. For this approach, we added exactly k new instances7 for each class, where k was selected to be the size of the smallest set of newly labeled instances among the six categories. The last row of Table 2 shows that this balanced self-training approach improved the average F score from 64.2% to 66.6%.
The most confident new instances were selected based on the differences between the scores for the winning class and the other classes.

Table 3 shows the results for medication use classification applied to gold standard medication mentions. The same trends hold: the sentential and syntactic features improve over n-grams, the SemTagger semantic features add value and outperform WordNet, and balanced self-training further improves performance. Overall performance increases from 66.6% to 75.1% F score with gold medications.

6 Conclusion
This research introduced a new task for classifying medication mentions with respect to their use in patient care. We created an effective medication detector for informal veterinary texts that exploits features derived from Web pages, and we created classifiers to recognize six medication use categories. These classifiers achieved precision  75% for all categories except Other, with recall ranging from 54% for Effects to 86% for Questions. This research is a first step toward NLP systems that can acquire empirical data about the administration and effectiveness of medications from unstructured text.
