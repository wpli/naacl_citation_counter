Table 3: Mapping function between bits and English characters in the All Letter Method.

Our next technique (Frequency Method) modifies the phrase table by assigning short bit codes to frequent words, and long bit codes to infrequent words. For example: din ||| 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 through ||| 1 1 1 1 yields ||| 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 Note that the word din is now mapped to a 9-bit sequence rather than a 3-bit sequence. More precisely, we map each word to a random bit sequence of length max(1, - × log P(word) +  ) . By changing variables  and  we can vary between smooth but long sentences ( = 1 and  = 0) to XKCD-style phrases ( = 0 and  = 15). Table 1 shows example sentences we obtain with  = 2.5 and  = -2.5, yielding sentences of 9.7 words on average. 2.5 Poetry In ancient times, people recorded long, historical epics using poetry, to enhance memorability. We follow this idea by turning each system-assigned 60-bit string into a short, distinct English poem. Our format is the rhyming iambic tetrameter couplet: · The poem contains two lines of eight syllables each. · Lines are in iambic meter, i.e., their syllables have the stress pattern 01010101, where 0 represents an unstressed syllable, and 1 represents a stressed syllable. We also allow 01010100, to allow a line to end in a word like Angela. · The two lines end in a pair of rhyming words. Words rhyme if their phoneme sequences match from the final stressed vowel onwards. We obtain stress patterns and phoneme sequences from the CMU pronunciation dictionary.4 Monosyllabic words cause trouble, because their stress often depends on context (Greene et al., 2010). For example, eighth is stressed in eighth street, but not in eighth avenue. This makes it hard to guarantee that automatically-generated lines will scan as intended. We therefore eject all monosyllabic words

bit string. Our next technique (All Letter Method) non-deterministically translates every bit into an English letter, per Table 3. Additionally, we nondeterministically introduce a space (or not) between each pair of letters. This yields 4 · 1084 possible output strings per input, 3 · 1056 of which consist of legal English words. From those 3 · 1056 strings, we choose the one that yields the best word 5-gram score. It is not immediately clear how to process a letterbased lattice with a word-based language model. We solve this search problem by casting it as one of machine translation from bit-strings to English. We create a phrase translation table by pairing each English word with a corresponding "bit phrase", using Table 3 in reverse. Sample entries include: din ||| 1 0 1 through ||| 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 yields ||| 1 0 0 1 1 1 We then use the Moses machine translation toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) to search for the 1-best translation of our input 60-bit string, using the phrase table and a 5-gram English LM, disallowing re-ordering. Table 1 shows that these sentences are shorter than the mnemonic method (11.8 words versus 15 words), without losing fluency. Given a generated English sequence, we can deterministically reconstruct the original 60-bit input string, using the above phrase table in reverse. 2.4 Frequency Method

Sentence passwords from the previous method contain 70.8 characters on average (including spaces). Classic studies by Shannon (1951) and others estimate that printed English may ultimately be compressible to about one bit per character. This implies we might be able to produce shorter output (60 characters, including space) while maintaining normal English fluency. 1572
