with SemCor frequency below five. Buitelaar et al. (2001) presented the knowledge based approach for ranking GermaNet synsets on specific domains. Lapata et al. (2004) worked on detecting the predominant sense of verbs where verb senses are taken from the Levin classes. Our approach is similar to that of McCarthy et al. (2007) as we are also learning predominant senses from the untagged text.

Conclusion and Future Work

In our paper, we presented an unsupervised approach for finding the most frequent sense for nouns by exploiting word embeddings. Our approach is tested on Hindi and English WSD. It is found that our approach outperforms the WFS baseline for Hindi. As the frequency of noun increases in the corpus, our approach outperforms the baseline for both Hindi and English WSD. Our approach can be easily ported to various domains and across languages. In future, we plan to improve on the performance of our model for English, even for infrequent words. Also, we will explore this approach for other languages and for other parts-of-speech.
