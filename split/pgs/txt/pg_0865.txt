Sentence [The bird]e1 perched on the [limb]e2 and [it]pro bent. [The bee]e1 landed on [the flower]e2 because [it]pro had pollen. [Bill]e1 was robbed by [John]e2 , so the officer arrested [him]pro . [Jimbo]e1 was afraid of [Bobbert]e2 because [he]pro gets scared around new people. [Lakshman]e1 asked [Vivan]e2 to get him some ice cream because [he]pro was hot. Paula liked [Ness]e1 more than [Pokey]e2 because [he]pro was mean to her.

Table 1: Example sentences for each schema category. The annotated entities and pronouns are hard coreference problems.
Type 1 2 Schema form predm (m, a) predm (m, a) |predm (m, a) , cn Explanation of examples from Table 1 Example 1.2: It is enough to know that: S (have (m = [the flower], a = [pollen])) > S (have (m = [the bee], a = [pollen])) Example 2.2: It is enough to know that: S (be afraid of (m = , a = ) |get scared (m = , a = ) , because) > S (be afraid of (a = , m = ) |get scared (m = , a = ) , because)

Table 2: Predicate Schemas and examples of the logic behind the schema design. Here  indicates that the argument is dropped, and S (.) denotes the scoring function defined in the text. S (predm (m, a)) S (predm (a, m)) S (predm (m, )) S (predm (, m)) S predm (m, a) |predm (m, a) , cn Type 2 S predm (a, m) |predm (m, a) , cn S predm (m, a) |predm (a, m) , cn S predm (a, m) |predm (a, m) , cn S predm (m, ) |predm (m, ) , cn . . . Table 3: Possible variations for scoring function statistics. Here  indicates that the argument is dropped. is prede1 = prede2 ="perch on". cn refers to the discourse connective (cn="and" in sentence 1.1). a denotes an argument of predm other than m. For example, in sentence 1.1, assuming that m = e1 , the corresponding argument is a = e2 . We represent the knowledge needed with two types of Predicate Schemas (as depicted in Table 2). To solve the assignment of [it]pro in sentence 1.1, as mentioned in Section 1, we need the knowledge that "a limb bends" is more reasonable than "a bird bends". Note that the predicate of the pronoun is playing a key role here. Also the entity mention it811 self is essential. Similarly, for sentence 1.2, to resolve [it]pro , we need the knowledge that "bee had pollen" is more reasonable than "flower had pollen". Here, in addition to entity mention and the predicate (of the pronoun), we need the argument which shares the predicate with the pronoun. To formally define the type of knowledge needed we denote it with "predm (m, a)" where m and a are a mention and an argument, respectively2 . We use S (.) to denote the score representing how likely the combination of the predicate-mention-argument is. For each schema, we use several variations by either changing the order of the arguments (subj. vs obj.) or dropping either of them. We score the various Type 1 and Type 2 schemas (shown in Table 3) differently. The first row of Table 2 shows how Type 1 schema is being used in the case of Sentence 1.2. For sentence 2.2, we need to have the knowledge that the subject of the verb phrase "be afraid of" is more likely than the object of the verb phrase "be afraid of" to be the subject of the verb phrase "get scared". The structure here is more complicated than that of Type 1 schema. To make it clearer, we analyze sentence 2.1. In this sentence, the object of "be robbed by" is more likely than the subject
2 Note that the order of m and a relative to the predicate is a critical issue. To keep things general in the schemas definition, we do not show the ordering; however, when using scores in practice the order between a mention and an argument is a critical issue.
