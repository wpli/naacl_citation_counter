WinoCoref dataset in Table 10. These results use the best performing KnowComb system. They show that both Type 1 and Type 2 schema knowledge have higher precision on Category 1 and Category 2 data instances, respectively, compared to that on full data. Type 1 and Type 2 knowledge have similiar performance on full data, but the results show that it is harder to solve instances in category 2 than those in category 1. Also, the performance drop between Cat1/Cat2 and full data indicates that there is a need to design more complicated knowledge schemas and to refine the knowledge acquisition for further performance improvement.

With the development of machine learning based models (Connolly et al., 1994; Soon et al., 2001b; Ng and Cardie, 2002a), attention shifted to solving standard coreference resolution problems. However, many hard coreference problems involve pronouns. As Winograd's schema shows, there is still a need for further investigation in this subarea. World Knowledge Acquisition: Many tasks in NLP (such as Textual Entailment, Question Answering, etc.) require World Knowledge. Although there are many existing works on acquiring them (Schwartz and Gomez, 2009; Balasubramanian et al., 2013; Tandon et al., 2014), there is still no consensus on how to represent, gather and utilize high quality World Knowledge. When it comes to coreference resolution, there are a handful of works which either use web query information or apply alignment to an external knowledge base (Rahman and Ng, 2011b; Kobdani et al., 2011; Ratinov and Roth, 2012; Bansal and Klein, 2012; Zheng et al., 2013). With the introduction of Predicate Schema, our goal is to bring these different approaches together and provide a coherent view.

Winograd Schema: Winograd (1972) showed that small changes in context could completely change coreference decisions. Levesque et al. (2011) proposed to assemble a set of sentences which comply with Winograd's schema. Specifically, there are pairs of sentences which are identical except for minor differences which lead to different references of the same pronoun in both sentences. These references can be easily solved by humans, but are hard, he claimed, for computer programs. Anaphora Resolution: There has been a lot of work on anaphora resolution in the past two decades. Many of the early rule-based systems like Hobbs (1978) and Lappin and Leass (1994) gained considerable popularity. The early designs were easy to understand and the rules were designed manually. 817
