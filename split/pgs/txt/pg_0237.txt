folding events may naturally have less stable vocabularies. In both cases, detecting and pinpointing reporting bias is central to the study of agenda-setting. These observations suggest that for certain applications, identifying consistent topics across multiple models may be equally critical as, if not more than, enforcing topical coherence within a single model. Increasingly, text analysis relies on data-dependent modeling decisions. Rare word removal can substantively alter analysis outcomes, but selecting an appropriate threshold requires inspecting the content of a text corpus. TopicCheck can help archive the exact context of analysis, allowing researchers to justify -- and readers to verify and challenge -- modeling decisions through access to data. Finally, topic modeling has dramatically lowered the costs associated with content analysis, allowing hundreds of models to be built in parallel. The current intended user task for TopicCheck is to validate the stability of presumably identical models. We plan to develop additional tools to help social scientists design better models, and actively explore the effects of alternative coding schemes.

Conclusion

We present TopicCheck for assessing topic model stability. Through its development, we demonstrate that existing research on reproducible manual codification can be transferred and applied to computational approaches such as automated content analysis via topic modeling. We hope this work will help computer scientists and social scientists engage in deeper conversations about research reproducibility for large-scale computer-assisted text analysis.
