ture previous-word (:, rocks, and in). This process is repeated for each earthquake individually, because tokens may be labeled differently in different earthquakes. This approach produced 37% more features than the DS-CRF baseline.16 The positive effect of feature aggregation is confirmed by the formal evaluation on the test dataset. Table 5 shows a statistically significant improvement in overall F1, for the lenient evaluation. The P/R curves (Fig. 2) indicate that DSaggr -CRF's improvement comes from both better recall and better precision that the DS-CRF baseline. Table 5 and Fig. 2 also show that the combination of approximate matching and aggregation outperforms the individual models, demonstrating that feature aggregation is complementary to approximate matching. The combined model attains a relative improvement of 33% over the DS-CRF baseline, reaching approximately 88% of the ceiling performance for this task (MA-CRF row, the CRF trained on manual annotations).

Related work

There has been considerable recent interest in IE from Twitter. However, in general, these works use supervised learning frameworks (Popescu et al., 2011; Ritter et al., 2012), and/or they use either a coarse representation of events, which reduces to topic modeling or classification of entire tweets (Popescu et al., 2011; Becker et al., 2011; Ritter et al., 2012), or a simplified representation of events with few arguments (Sakaki et al., 2010; Popescu et al., 2011; Benson et al., 2011; Ritter et al., 2012). In contrast, our work uses a complex event representation with 20 arguments, and does not require any manual annotation of tweets. Our work is closest, but complementary to the work of (Benson et al., 2011), which also uses distant supervision for event extraction: We provide solutions for two problems they do not address (inaccurate and ambiguous information) and we focus on more complex events (20 arguments vs. two). This paper is also complementary to systems which detect event-relevant tweets (Sakaki et al.,
16 We also tried skip-chain CRFs (Getoor and Taskar, 2007), but found that our simpler approach converges considerably faster and produces slightly better results. We do not show those results for brevity.

2010; Petrovi´ c et al., 2010). In future work, we plan to replace our simple method of extracting relevant tweets by one of these approaches, producing a system that monitors microblogs in realtime to automatically construct event-specific knowledge bases. Our work uses the framework of distant supervision, which has also received considerable attention recently. Nevertheless, most of these works focus on the extraction of binary relations from well-formed documents (Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012). We use the much noisier Twitter as the underlying text, and extract complex events instead of binary relations. We note, however, that the idea of feature aggregation is inspired by these works (Mintz et al., 2009; Riedel et al., 2010), but, to our knowledge, we are the first to apply it to event extraction and sequence tagging. In the DS space, our work is closest to (Reschke et al., 2014), which use it to extract complex events (airplane crashes) from newswire text. Because they focus on newswire, they do not need to address the potential for inaccurate or ambiguous information, which is the main focus of our work.

Discussion: An alternate evaluation measure

Designing relevant measures for lenient evaluations, such as the one discussed here, is an open research issue. For example, the method proposed in Section 4 gives partial credit to all reported (positive) numeric values in the interval [0, 2g ], where g is the correct value for the corresponding slot (see the equation in Section 4). But other, stricter, measures
