Finnish errors tend to fall into one of three types. First, words that involve harmonically neutral vowels, such as "e" and "i" occasionally cause errors in vowel harmony. Second, all three systems have difficulty identifying syllable and compound boundaries, and make errors predicting vowels near boundaries. Finally, consonant gradation, which alternates consonants in open and closed syllables, causes a relatively large number of errors; for example, our system predicts *heltempien, instead of the correct hellempien as the genitive singular of the comparative adjective hellempi "more affectionate".

Conclusion

We have proposed an alternative method of generating inflected word-forms which is based on discriminative string transduction and reranking. We have conducted a series of experiments on nine datasets involving six languages, including four new datasets that we created. The results demonstrate that our method is not only highly accurate, but also robust against incomplete or limited inflection data. In the future, we would like to apply our method to nonEuropean languages, with different morphological systems. We also plan to investigate methods of extracting morphological tags from a corpus, including differentiating syncretic forms in context.
