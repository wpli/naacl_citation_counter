Finally, my gratitude goes to everyone else who contributed to the success of the conference: area chairs, workshop organizers, tutorial presenters, student mentors, and reviewers. And of course my deepest thanks to you, the attendees: you are the life and spirit of this entire conference. Here is to an enjoyable NAACL-HLT 2015, and many more exciting conferences to come!
