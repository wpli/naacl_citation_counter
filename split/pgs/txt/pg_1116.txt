Boldface indicates statistical significance vs. other results in the same column using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p < 0.05). On average, the output from our system is ranked higher than all other alternatives.

RANDOM ly selected comments, USER ' S - PICKS (ranked by positive user ratings), randomly selected EDITOR ' S - PICKS and timelines produced by the T HREAD +O PTWordVec version of OUR SYSTEM. We also include one noisy comment summary (i.e. irrelevant to the question) to avoid spam. We display two comments per day for each system.6 Turkers are asked to rank the comment summary variations according to informativeness and insightfulness. For informativeness, we ask the Turkers to judge based only on knowledge displayed in the timeline, and to rate each comment summary based on how much relevant information they learn from it. For insightfulness, Turkers are required to focus on insights and valuable opinions. They are requested to leave a short explanation of their ranking. 15 five-day periods are randomly selected. We solicit four distinct Turkers located in the U.S. to evaluate each set of timelines. An inter-rater agreement of Krippendorff's  of 0.63 is achieved for informativeness ranking and  is 0.50 for insightfulness ranking. Table 5 shows the percentage of times a particular method is selected as producing the best comment portion of the timeline, as well as the microaverage rank of each method, for both informativeness and insightfulness. Our system is selected as the best in 66.7% of the evaluations for informativeness and 51.7% for insightfulness. In both cases, we statistically significantly outperform (p < 0.05 using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test) the editor's-picks

and user's-picks. Turkers' explanations indicate that they prefer our comment summaries mainly because they are "very informative and insightful to what was happening", and "show the sharpness of the commenter". Turkers sometimes think the summaries randomly selected from editor's-picks "lack connection", and characterize user's-picks as "the information was somewhat limited".

Human Evaluation of Event Threading

For our system, we select the two comments with highest importance scores from the comment summary.

Here we evaluate on the utility of event threads for high-level information access guidance: can event threads allow users to easily locate and absorb information with a specific interest in mind? We first sample a 10-day timeline for each dataset from those produced by the T HREAD +O PTWordVec
