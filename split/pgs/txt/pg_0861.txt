course connectives based on their distributional semantic properties and found that certain classes of discourse connectives cannot be omitted in every context, which plague the weakly labeled data used in previous studies. Our discourse connective classification allows for the better selection of data points for distant supervision. More importantly, this work presents a new direction in distantly supervised learning paradigm for implicit discourse relation classification. This virtual dramatic increase in the training set size allows for more feature engineering and more sophisticated models. Implicit discourse relation classification is now no longer limited to strictly supervised learning approaches.
