Table 3: Annotation counts. Over 44% of potential spatial knowledge can be inferred (certYES and certNO). tion before and after. In other words, annotators understood that (1) the car was moving down a road and arrived at the intersection; (2) then, it was pulled over by a security guard who is probably stationed at the intersection; and (3) after the stop, the car probably continued with its route but the guard probably stayed at the intersection. 3.3 Annotation Analysis Each annotator answered 1,995 questions generated with Algorithm 1. Basic label counts after resolving conflicts are shown in Table 3. First, it is worth noting that annotators used UNK to answer only 5.26% of questions. Thus, over 94% of times ARGM - LOC semantic role is found, additional spatial knowledge can be inferred with some degree of certainty. Second, annotators were certain about the additional spatial knowledge, i.e., labels certYES and certNO, 35.94% and 8.72% of times respectively. Thus, 44% of times one encounters ARGM - LOC seman456

Finally, annotators answered around 50% of questions with probYES or probNO. In other words, they found it likely that spatial information can be inferred, but were not completely certain. 3.3.1 Inter-Annotator Agreements Table 4 presents observed agreements, i.e., raw percentage of equal annotations, and Cohen Kappa scores (Cohen, 1960) per temporal anchor and for all questions. Kappa scores are above 0.80, indicating "good reliability" (Artstein and Poesio, 2008).
