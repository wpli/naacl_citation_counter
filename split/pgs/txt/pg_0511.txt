Table 5: Feature set to infer temporally-anchored spatial knowledge from semantic role representations. We believe the high Kappa scores are due to the fact that we start from PropBank-style roles instead of plain text, and questions asked are intuitive. Note that not all disagreements are equal, e.g., the difference between certYES and certNO is much larger than the difference between certYES and probYES.

4 Inferring Spatial Knowledge
We follow a standard supervised machine learning approach. The 200 sentences were divided into train (80%) and test (20%), and the corresponding instances assigned to the train and test sets.8 We trained an SVM with RBF kernel using scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011). Parameters C and  were tuned using 10-fold cross-validation with the training set, and results are calculated with test instances. 4.1 Feature selection

we describe semantic features, which include any feature derived from semantic role representations. Features 30­33 correspond to the surface form and POS tag of the verbs to which x and y attach to. Feature 34 indicates the semantic role between xpred and x; note that the semantic role between ypred and y is always ARGM - LOC (Algorithm 1). Feature 35 distinguishes inferences of type (1a) from (1b) (Section 2.2): it indicates whether both x and y attach to the same verb, as in Figure 1, or not, as in Figure 2. Features 36­39 encode the first and last semantic role of xpred and ypred by order of appearance. Features 40­59 are binary flags signalling which se-

Selected features (Table 5) are a mix of lexical, syntactic and semantic features, and are extracted from tokens (words and POS tags), full parse trees and semantic roles. Lexical and syntactic features are standard in semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) and we do not elaborate on them. Hereafter
Splitting instances randomly would be unfair, as instances from the same sentence would be assigned to the train and test sets. Thank you to an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out.
