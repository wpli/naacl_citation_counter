(6) The item Eq [log A( , )] involves the hard-tocompute partition function, which has no analytical expressions. We discuss how to deal with it in the sequel. With Taylor expansion, we can obtain an upper bound of Eq [log A( , )] Eq [log A( , )]  c-1 Eq [A( , )] - 1 + log c (7) where c  0 is a new variational parameter. Eq [A( , )] can be further upper bounded as Eq [log A( , )]  exp{ Eq [

(10) Given this upper bound, we can obtain a lower bound of the variational lower bound defined in Eq.(5). Variational parameters and model parameters can be learned by maximizing the lower bound using iterative EM algorithm. In E-step, we fix the model parameters and compute the variational parameters by setting the derivatives of the lower bound w.r.t the variational parameters to zero

(12) In Eq.(12), N (i) denotes the words that are labeled to be similar to i. As can be seen from this equation, the probability ik that word i is assigned to topic k depends on the probability jk of i's correlated words j . This explains how our model can incorporate word correlations in topic assignments.

In this section, we corroborate the effectiveness of our model by comparing it with three baseline methods on two datasets.
