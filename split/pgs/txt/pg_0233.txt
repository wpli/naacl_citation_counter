Figure 1: This chart shows topics uncovered from 13,250 political blogs (Eisenstein and Xing, 2010) by 50 structural topic models (Roberts et al., 2013). Latent topics are represented as rectangles; bar charts within the rectangles represent top terms in a topic. Topics belonging to the same model are arranged in a column; topics assigned to the same group are arranged in a row. This chart is completely filled with topics only if perfect alignment occurs. When topics in a model fail to align with topics in other models, empty cells appear in its column. Similarly, when topics in a group are not consistently uncovered by all models, empty cells appear in its row. Hovering over a term highlights all other occurrences of the same term. Top terms belonging to each topical group are shown on the right; they represent the most frequent words over all topics in the group, by summing their probability distributions.

Figure 2: Continued from Figure 1, users may decrease the similarity threshold to generate additional groupings of topics that are less consistent, uncovered by as few as 3 of the 50 modeling runs.

hausted, at which point the procedure terminates. Users can specify a similarity threshold, below which topical groups are considered to differ too much to be matched. Two groups are allowed to merge only if both of the following conditions are met: their similarity is above the user-defined sim179

ilarity threshold and every topic in the combined group belongs to a different model. 4.2 Tabular Layout and User Interactions

We devise a tabular layout to present the alignment output at all levels of detail: groups, models, topics,
