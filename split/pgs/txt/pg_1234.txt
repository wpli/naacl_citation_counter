provements in efficiency of retrieval. So far we could achieve substantial reductions in retrieval complexity by pre-filtering based on coarse term matches. The inherent complexity of SMT decoding is less of a problem in offline applications such as translation retrieval (Dong et al., 2014), but it becomes prohibitive in online applications such as cross-lingual web search. In future work, we would like to address efficiency, e.g. by investigating the possibility of incorporating an inverted index into online applications of forced decoding.
