Conclusions

We have proposed the LCCT model for semisupervised sentiment classification, combining the idea of lexicon-based learning and corpus-based learning in a unified co-training framework. It is capable of incorporating both domain-specific and domain-independent knowledge. Comparing to state-of-the-art sentiment classification methods, the LCCT approach exhibits significantly better performances on a variety of datasets in both English and Chinese, even with a small portion of labeled data.
