linear projections are up to three orders of magnitudes faster once phrasal representations have been learned and can be as accurate. Our novel local linear projection is much more accurate than the global projection of Mikolov et al. (2013a) at only a small increase in running time. This brings us closer to generating new translation rules on-the-fly for unseen sentences. Finally, we showed that redundant bit vectors are three times faster but also significantly more accurate than locality sensitive hashing in our setting. To our knowledge this is the first application of redundant bit vectors on a natural language processing task. In future work, we would like to investigate more elaborate projection schemes that use contextual information from the source side or non-linear projections. Furthermore, we would like to apply redundant bit vectors to other NLP tasks.
